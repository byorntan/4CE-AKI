\description{
This table contains ICD10 codes for diagnoses pertaining to the following broad categories:
\enumerate{
\item Cardiovascular Risk Factors (Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart
disease)
\item Chronic kidney disease / End-stage Renal Failure
\item Malignancies (solid tumours, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders)
\item Thrombo-embolic events (e.g. pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thromboembolism,
arterial thromboembolism)
\item Pulmonary diseases (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis,
interstitial lung diseases)
\item Rheumatological conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic
sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, Sjogren's syndrome)
}

This table is a truncated version derived from the main table comorbid_ref.
}
\details{
The headers in the table are as follows:
icd_code  full_code comorbid_type

icd_code - shortened ICD code (see below)
full_code - full ICD code (see below)
comorbid_type - diagnosis category as above

Due to the variations in the way ICD codes may be stored, we have adhered to the following conventions:
\itemize{
\item icd_code will store the broad category of the diagnosis
\item Full ICD diagnosis codes will have the major category abd subcategory separated by a period
For example, the ICD-9 diagnosis "Chronic kidney disease, Stage V" with full code 585.5 will have
icd_code = "585" and full_code = "585.5".
Please ensure that your data tables store diagnoses codes as their broad categories. (e.g. 585.5 will be
stored as "585").
In future versions, this convention may be changed depending on the granularity required for analysis.
